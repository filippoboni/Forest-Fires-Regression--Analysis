## Introduction

Forest fires analysis through regression to predict possible fires and burned area;
in this project our aim is, in the first part, to predict the burned area of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal. Our prediction will be based on spacial, temporal and weather variables where the fire is spotted.  

## Dataset Overview

The data we are using to predict the creation and the intensity of forest fires has been created by Cortez and Moraiz and acquired from the UCI Machine Learning Repo. It consists of 517 observations of forest fires and wildfires from Montesinho Park, located in Portugal, collected from January 2000 to December 2003. The dataset is composed by 13 variables including the output variable *area* (i.e. the area of the forest fire in hectares) and 12 explanatory variables consisting of spatial and temporal variables, FWI component variables and weather variables.

#### Variables 

```{r}
#read data
fires <- read.csv(file = "forestfires.csv",header = TRUE)

#set the levels of month and day
fires$month <- factor(fires$month,levels =  c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr",
                      "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec"))
fires$day <- factor(fires$day,levels =  c("mon", "tue","wed", "thu",
                                          "fri", "sat", "sun"))

attach(fires)
head(fires)
```

#### Exploratory visualization of data

Let's first visualize the distribution of the quantitative variables
```{r fig2, fig.height=5,fig.width=6}
par(mfrow=c(3,4))
hist(fires$area,100,main = "area",xlab = "")
hist(fires$X,100,main = "X",xlab = "")
hist(fires$Y,100,main = "Y",xlab = "")
hist(fires$FFMC,100,main = "FFMC",xlab = "")
hist(fires$DMC,100,main = "DMC",xlab = "")
hist(fires$DC,100,main = "DC",xlab = "")
hist(fires$ISI,100,main = "ISI",xlab = "")
hist(fires$temp,100,main = "temp",xlab = "")
hist(fires$RH,100,main = "RH",xlab = "")
hist(fires$wind,100,main = "wind",xlab = "")
hist(fires$rain,70,main = "rain",xlab = "")
```

Let's visualize better the number of zero values of the *area* variable (representing a burned area smaller than $100 m^2$) and *rain* variable with respect to the number of values greater that zero. 
```{r}
big_fire <- rep("No",length(fires$X))
big_fire[fires$area>0] <-"Yes"
rain_yes <- rep("No",length(fires$X))
rain_yes[fires$rain>0]<-"Yes"

area_count <- ggplot(fires,aes(x=big_fire))+
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue")+ 
  xlab("Big Fire") + theme_minimal(base_size = 5)
rain_count <-ggplot(fires,aes(x=rain_yes))+
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue")+ 
  xlab("Rain") + theme_minimal(base_size = 5)

grid.arrange(area_count,rain_count,ncol=2)
```

The high skeweness of these two variables and the high number of zero values will be tackled in the ####processing phase and again in the second part when we will transform the analysis in a logistic regression task.

#### Correlations

Let's now study the correlations among the variables, excluding the categorical ones
```{r}
drop_vars <- names(fires) %in% c("month","day","rain")
ggcorr(fires[!drop_vars],label = TRUE, label_size=4, label_color='black')
```

As we can see from the correlation plot, some variables are positively correlated (like DC-DMC and X-Y) and temp-RH are negatively correlated; however I believe that the correlations are not so high to induce multicollinearity in the models. 
```{r}
sqrt(vif(lm(log(area+1) ~.,data = fires)))
```


#### Processing

Form the previous histograms we can see that *area* and *rain* are highly positively skewed with quite a lot of zero values. 
As suggested from the paper of Martinez, to reduce the skeweness and and improve simmetry, the $log(x + 1)$ transformation was applied to the area attribute. As we can see from the left histogram, the area is now less right-skewed and has a more gaussian shape, allowing us to stick with the normality assumption necessary for linear regression. During the later experiments, *area* will always be $log(x+1)$ transformed. 
```{r}
#skewness of the target variable
area_plot <-ggplot(data = fires)+
  geom_histogram(aes(area),binwidth = 40)+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11)+
  xlab("Burned area (in hectares)")

#applying log transformation to get a more gaussian like shape and adding 1 to account
#for zero values
log_area_plot<-ggplot(data = fires)+
  geom_histogram(aes(log(area+1)),binwidth = 0.3,fill = "steelblue")+
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11)+
  xlab("Ln(area +1)")   
  
grid.arrange(area_plot,log_area_plot,ncol=2)
```

Before applying any transformation to *rain* let's observe that only 8 are non zero values and consequently the variance of this variable will be very low. I strongly believe that this variable will have a very low predictive power so it make sense to remove it and simplify the model.
```{r}
table(fires$rain)
var(fires$rain)
```
Finally we can see that spatial variables "X" and "Y" are both dummy variables ranging from 1-9 and 2-9.
```{r}
fires$X <- as.factor(fires$X)
fires$Y <- as.factor(fires$Y)
```

The dataset we are going to use for our regression task will be:
```{r warning=TRUE}
drop_cols <- names(fires) %in% c("rain")
fires_reg <- fires[!drop_cols]
attach(fires_reg)
head(fires_reg)
```



## Regression Models

The first model we are gonna build is the general linear model.

In the general linear model the main focus is to describe the probabilistic behaviour of a set of a quantitative responses $y_1...y_n$, considered realization of normal random variables $Y_1...Y_n$, in terms of a set of predictors collected in a matrix $X$.

Matematically, a general linear model is represented by the following linear combination $$Y = X\beta + \epsilon$$ where $X$ is a $n \times p$ matrix containing a first column of 1 (that represent the intercept of the regression line) followed by the values of the p-1 predictors for all the n samples,$\beta$ is the column vector of dimension p-1 of parameters main object of the statistical inference and finally the $\epsilon$ n-dimensional column vector is a set of unobservable random variables (also called errors) which account for natural variability and other sources of uncertainty. This vector is assumed to represent a situation of normally distributed i.i.d errors added to the signal $X\beta$  with $\mu = 0$ and $var = \sigma^2I_{n \times n}$.

The normality assumption of $\epsilon$ implies that Y will be normally distributed with each element having the same variance $$Y=X\beta + \epsilon \sim N_n(X\beta,\sigma^2I_{n \times n})$$

#### OLS Regression

Thanks to the assumption of Gaussian noise we can find the line for which the probability of the data is highest by solving the following optimization problem (inserisci sotto la spiegazione matematica per cui si passa dal max likelyhood al minimization problem): $$min_\beta \sum_{i=1} (y_i-X_i\beta)^2$$ where $min_\beta$ just means "find the value of $\beta$ that minimize the following", $X_i$ refers to the row $i$ of the matrix $X$ and $y_i$ is the i-th element of the column vector of the realizations of $Y$.

By using some basic linear algebra to solve this minimization problem and assuming $X^T X$ is invertible, we can find the optimal estimates of $\beta$ $$\hat{\beta}(X^T X)^{-1}X^Ty$$ and the corresponding estimator, normally distributed too, being a linear combination of $Y$ $$\hat{\beta}(X^T X)^{-1}X^TY \sim N_p(\beta,\sigma^2(X^TX)^{-1})$$.  

To properly interpret the coefficients of the OLS model, the following statistical assumptions must be satisfied:

- *Normality* For fixed values of the independent variables, the dependent variable is normally distributed

- *Independence* The observations are independent of each other (assumed to be true during the data collection process)

- *Linearity* The true relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear

- *Homoscedasticity* The variance of the dependent variable doesnâ€™t vary with the levels of the independent variables.

In the following sections, we will select different subset of explanatory variables, compute the OLS estimate and, after evaluating the best performing one, assess the satisfaction of the previous 4 points to validate it.

#### Simple model

Let's first build a simple model with a single continuous predictor (*temp*) to give better insights on how to interpret a linear regression model.
In the simple linear regression settings we are going to fit a line $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$ to our data in order to find the *least squares line* (the best linear approximation to the true relation $area = \beta_0 + \beta_1temp$, also called *population regression line*). 
The minimization problem becomes $$min_{\beta_0,\beta_1} \sum[y_i-(\beta_0+\beta_1x_i)]^2$$ and the solution is $$\hat{\beta_1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$$ $$\hat{\beta_0} = \bar{y}-\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}$$ where $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are the sample means.

Below, the *summary()* results of the simple linear model are displayed:

```{r}
##first simple linear regression model 
lm.simple <- lm(log(area+1) ~ temp,data = fires_reg)
summary(lm.simple)
```

The *Residuals* section displays some points of the residuals distribution giving some insights on how well the model is performing. Residuals are calculated as $Y-\hat{Y}$ so high values of residuals means predictions far from the ground-truth.

In the *Coefficients* part we have the estimated values of the coefficients ($\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}$), the Std. Error, useful to build confidence intervals on the true parameter $\beta_i$ with the form $\hat{\beta_i} Â± 2SE(\hat{\beta_i})$, the t-values and the related p-values useful to reject or fail to reject the $H_0: \beta_i = 0$ for a explanatory variable *i*, when all the others variables are in the model. In this simple regression model we see that the *intercept* ha a low p-value (reject $H_0:\beta_0 = 0$) while *temp* has a high p-value (with a given confidence level the true value of $\beta_1$ is zero so it has no effect on the response variable). The same result can be deduced by observing the CI:
```{r}
confint(lm.simple)
```
having *temp* the zero value included in his confidence interval we make our believe to drop this variable stronger.

Finally in the last part we have the *Residual Standard Error* (an estimate of the standard deviation of the errors $\epsilon$), the $R^2$ Statistics that provides a measure of fit in terms of the proportion of variance explained by the model and the *Global F Test*, to test the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_1=\beta_2=...=\beta_{p-1}=0$ basing on the p-value. In our case the high *RSE* and the low $R^2$ statistics indicates a bad performing model.

#### Complete model

In this section we will create a basic model containing all the predictors and see how it behaves.
```{r}
lm.big <- lm(log(area+1) ~ .,data=fires_reg)
summary(lm.big)
```
The reason why I decided to report the *summary()* of the complete model, even if 19 rows are omitted, is to point out how categorical variables with many levels (like *X*,*Y*,*day* and *month* in our case) are handled and how to interpret them. In general, when a factor has $l$ levels, $l-1$ dummy variables are used to code it, taking as reference the first level. The reason behind the $l-1$ is that we would generate linearly dependent columns in the $X$ matrix, making $X^\prime X$ a non invertible matrix, assumption necessary for OLS estimates. 

For *day* and *month* the first levels taken as reference are:
```{r}
levels(day)[1]
levels(month)[1]
```
Their coefficients are:
```{r}
#day coefficients
round(lm.big$coefficients[grep("day",names(coefficients(lm.big)))],3)
#month coefficients
round(lm.big$coefficients[grep("month",names(coefficients(lm.big)))],3)
```
The coefficients represent the average area burnt with respect to the reference level and by analizing the *day* factor we can see that the highest coefficients values are in the weekend ("weekend effect") where the turism is higher and humans may have caused fires. As far as the *month*, December has the highest coefficients, and also here turism may play a key role in causing fires. 

Similarly, by analyzing the coefficients of the spacial variables ($X\&Y$) I believe we can observe the coordinates where the most of the fires took place and deduce information about the territory (how much forest, presence of rivers etc...).

#### Smaller models

Following the Cortez work, four distinct feature selection setups were tested: 

- *STFWI*: spatial, temporal and the four FWI components;

- *STM*: spatial, temporal and three weather variables (originally were four, but I removed *rain* in section xxx);

- *FWI*: the four FWI components;

- *M*: the three weather conditions;

```{r}
lm.STFWI <- lm(log(area+1) ~ X + Y + day + month + FFMC + ISI + 
                 DMC + DC, data = fires_reg)
lm.STM <- lm(log(area+1) ~ X + Y + day + month + temp + RH + 
               wind, data = fires_reg)
lm.FWI <- lm(log(area+1) ~ FFMC + ISI + DMC + DC, data = fires_reg)
lm.M <- lm(log(area+1) ~ temp + RH + wind, data = fires_reg)
```

#### ANOVA and AIC

A good practice to select among nested models is to use the *ANOVA* test. We test the null hypothesis that the added predictors (i.e. the predictors non in common btw the models) have zero coefficients using an F-statistic.
We will now compute the *ANOVA* test among the two couple of nested models defined above (lm.STFWI & lm.FWI, lm.STM & lm.m), including also the complete model:

```{r}
print(anova(lm.FWI,lm.STFWI,lm.big))

print(anova(lm.M,lm.STM,lm.big))
```

Looking at p-values for the F-statistic, we can conclude that the data does not provide enough evidence to reject the null in the case of *lm.STFWI* and *lm.STM*, while we fail to reject the null in the case of the *lm.big*. 

Another way of comparing models is the the *Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion*. *AIC* estimates the relative amount of information lost by a given model, focusing on the trade-off between the goodness of fit and the simplicity of the model. Lower values of information loss means higher quality of the model. $$AIC = 2(p+1) - 2ln(\hat{L})$$ where $\hat{L}$ is the maximized likelihood function and *p+1* is the number of estimated parameters in the model.

```{r}
as.matrix(AIC(lm.big,lm.STFWI,lm.STM,lm.FWI,lm.M))
```

As a tradeoff between the results obtained by the *ANOVA* tests and the *AIC* values, the model that seems to better fit the data with the lowest information loss is *lm.STFWI*, probably because it contains the temporal features (that as we saw in the xxx section can give some insights on human based fires), the spacial features (info about the territory) and the *FWI* indices that are built with the weather conditions.

#### K-fold Cross Validation

To take a further step in the analysis of the performances of the presented models, we are gonna use cross-validation, a statistical tool to estimate the test error associated with our models. Setting K=10 as in the *Cortez* work, the data is splitted into K subset. Each of this partitions is gonna serve as test set for the model trained on the remaining K-1 subsets and the prediction error is recorded. Finally, when all the K subsets has served as test set, the average of the recorded errors is computed.

For the computation of the cross-validation the library *caret* will be used and for the the evaluation of test error we will observe:

- $RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{y_i})^2}{n}}$ That is, the average difference between the observed known outcome values and the values predicted by the model. The lower the RMSE, the better the model.

- $R^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{Y_i}-\bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\bar{Y})}$ That is a measure of the variance explained by the model. The higher the $R^2$, the better the model.

- $MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i-\hat{y_i}|$ That is an alternative to $RMSE$ less sensitive to outliers. The lower the $RMSE$, the better the model.

```{r  warning=FALSE}
#defining training control
set.seed(1)
train.control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

#Train the models
model.big <- train(log(area+1) ~ .,data = fires_reg,method="lm",
                   trControl = train.control)
model.STFWI <- train(log(area+1) ~ X + Y + day + month + FFMC + ISI + DMC + DC, 
                     data = fires_reg,method = "lm",trControl = train.control)
model.STM <- train(log(area+1) ~ X + Y + day + month + temp + RH + wind, 
                   data = fires_reg, method = "lm",trControl = train.control)
model.FWI <- train(log(area+1) ~ FFMC + ISI + DMC + DC, 
                   data = fires_reg,method = "lm",trControl = train.control)
model.M <- train(log(area+1) ~ temp + RH + wind, 
                 data = fires_reg,method = "lm",trControl = train.control)

#summarize results
models <- c("big","STFWI","FWI","STM","M")
RMSE <- c(model.big$results$RMSE,model.STFWI$results$RMSE, 
          model.FWI$results$RMSE,model.STM$results$RMSE,model.M$results$RMSE)
R2 <- c(model.big$results$Rsquared,model.STFWI$results$Rsquared, 
        model.FWI$results$Rsquared,model.STM$results$Rsquared,model.M$results$Rsquared)
MAE <- c(model.big$results$MAE, model.STFWI$results$MAE,
         model.FWI$results$MAE,model.STM$results$MAE,model.M$results$MAE)

res.df <- data.frame(RMSE,R2,MAE)
row.names(res.df) <- models
as.matrix(res.df)
```
Analyzing these results we can see that in terms of variability explained by the model, the $STFWI$ is the one with better results; on the other hand $STM$ is the best performing one when we take also into consideration the prediction errors. 

#### Validation of the model

As anticipated in section xxx, we are now assessing the validity of the model by evaluating the statistical assumptions of a regression analysis by using the residuals (remember that residuals are the **observable** distance $e=Y-\hat{Y}$) for diagnostic purposes. 
```{r warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm.STM)
```
The *Residual vs Fitted* graph is useful to check for the linearity assumption: a horizontal line without distinct pattern is what we were looking for. As far as the normality of the response variable, we would expected values in the *Normal Q-Q* plot that followed the straight dotted line. Finally the *Scale-Location* graph have an increasing behaviuour and the variability of the residuals increases with the value of the fitted outcome variable.


We can conclude that the Normality and the Homescedascity assumptions are not respected, as we were expecting since the bad performance obtained in section model selection. I believe the zero values of the dataset and the presence of outliers are the majour cause to these results. In the following section we are going to model the *area* variable as categorical and explore that solution 

## Generalized Linear Model

The results obtained in *model selection*, expecially in *Validation of the model* shows how all the presented models are performing poorly and are not able to explain the response variable. 

In order to tackle the issue of the zero values in the dependent variable and to try to improve the predictions, similarly to the work by R. Rishickesh, A. Shahina, A. Nayeemulla Khan(cita meglio...), I moved to a **Logistic Regression** approach by encoding the *area* feature as a binary categorical feature.

#### Basic theory 

*Logistic Regression* belongs to Generalized linear models that, as for the general linear model, are characterized by a response vector $Y_1,...,Y_n$ of independent random variables with means $\mu_i = E(Y_i)$ and a linear combination of predictors $\eta = X\beta$. The new element wrt the "old model" is a **link function** that depends on the family of the $Y$ distribution and connect the means $\mu_i$ and the linear combination $\eta$: $$g(\mu_i) = \eta_i$$

The typical choice for bernoulli distributed response variables (as in our case with *area*) is the *logit link*: $$logit(p_i) = log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})$$ that follows a sigmoid function which limits its range of probabilities between 0 and 1, so that it make sense to apply the linear combination $$logit(p_i) = \sum_{j=0}^{p-1} \beta_jX_{ij}$$ 


If we apply the inverse transformation of the logit we obtain the *logistic distribution function (figurexx)*: $$p_i=\frac{e^{logit}}{1+e^{logit}}$$ 
where the probability $p_i=P(Y_i=1|X_i)$ is the focus of the prediction.

```{r}
#define the logistic distribution function
logistic <- function(l)(exp(l)/(1+exp(l)))
#draw the general graph
curve(logistic,from = -10,to = 10,xlab = "l",ylab = "logistic(l)")
```

#### Logistic Regression Models

This section will be devoted to the creation of the equivalent models created for the general linear regression analysis and their evaluation. For this purpose we create a new categorical column in the dataset called *dangerous_fire* with two levels: 
- **0** if the corresponding *area* value is equal to 0 (for not dangerous fires)
- **1** if the corresponding *area* value is greater than 0 (for dangerous fires)

```{r}
#create the dataset with the new categorical variable
drop_area <- names(fires) %in% c("area")
fires_cat <- fires[!drop_area]

#set the 2 levels
fires_cat$dangerous_fire[fires$area == 0] <- 0
fires_cat$dangerous_fire[fires$area>0] <- 1

#set the new column as a factor
fires_cat$dangerous_fire <- factor(fires_cat$dangerous_fire,levels = c(0,1))
```

#### Simple model 

Before diving into the main part of this GLM section, let's first build a simple model made by a continuous and a categorical independent variables, i.e. *temp* and *day*, to point out one big difference between linear and logistic models: the coefficient interpretation.
```{r}
#build the model
simple.glm <- glm(dangerous_fire ~ fires_cat$temp + fires_cat$day, data = fires_cat,
                  family = binomial(link = "logit"))

#extract the coefficients
coeff<-as.matrix(simple.glm$coefficients)
colnames(coeff)<-c("coefficients")
coeff
```

The coefficient of *temp* (0.03) in Logistic Regression correspond to the expected change in the log odds of being a big fire(*dangerous_fire = 1*) for a unit increase of *temp*, holding the other predictors at a fixed value (since as we saw it holds $logit(p_i) = \sum_{j=0}^{p-1} \beta_jX_{ij}$).

As far as the $l-1$ dummy variables created for *day* (where $l=7$) the coefficients represents the **odds ratio** of the odds that *dangerous_fire = 1* within that level of the categorical variable, compared to the odds of *dangerous_fire = 1* within the reference level (*daymon*). Let's take, for example, $\hat{\beta}_{daywed}$

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("daywed coefficient:", round(coeff[2],3))
```

If we encode with *c* all the other members of the linear combination except for *daywed*, we can write the logit as: $$logit(p_i) = c + 0.026daywed$$

Being *daywed* a dummy variable, we can write $$logit(p_i) = logit(P(dangerous\_fire_i=1)) = \begin{cases}c + 0.026 &\mbox {if}\;  daywed\:\mbox=\:1 \\c
&\mbox {if}\;  daywed\:\mbox=\:0 \end{cases}$$

Now we simply define 

- $p_{i1} = P(dangerous\_fire_i = 1|daywed = 1)$

- $p_{i0} = P(dangerous\_fire_i = 1|daywed = 0)$ or equivalently $p_{i0} = P(dangerous\_fire_i = 1|daymon = 1)$

and we can write the *daywed* coefficient as $$0.026 = log(\frac{\frac{p_{i1}}{1-p_{i1}}}{\frac{p_{i0}}{1-p_{i0}}})$$

that is the logodds ratio, a measure of comparing probabilities of success under two situations, in this case comparing the the probability of having a big fire being *daywed* with respect to its reference level *daymon*.

```{r}

```
