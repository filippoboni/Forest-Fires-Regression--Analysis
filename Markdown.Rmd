Forest fires analysis through regression to predict possible fires and burned area

## Dataset
firstly i read the dataset, then I add a binary column derived from fires$area with "yes" if the value of area is greater than zero, "no" otherwhise
```{r}
fires <- read.csv(file = "forestfires.csv")
attach(fires)
fires$fire <- rep("No",length(fires$X))
fires$fire[fires$area>0] <-"Yes"
```
